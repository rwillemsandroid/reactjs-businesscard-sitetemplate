Hello visitor!

My name is Raf Willems, I am a software engineer based in Belgium.

In order to get acquainted with Facebooks ReactJS and ReactNative frameworks, I've decided to build this simple one page ReactJS site with a small business card on it.

It is should be live and can be found on [www.raf-willems.be](http://www.raf-willems.be)

I'm aware there still are some flaws in the site here, as said before, this is just an ongoing learning repo subject to change.

Feel free to look at the code for your inspiration, but don't complain if it's broken :)
